# Virtual-Voice-Assistant
A voice-controlled assistant built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It listens to commands, responds with speech, and performs tasks like greeting based on time, opening websites, telling the time and date, and searching the web. It uses a male voice for a natural feel and greets only once per session. Simple, interactive, and easy to use.
